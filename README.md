Hi, I’m @marsett, I’m interested in programming and learn other types of technology.
I’m currently learning C#, Javascript and Python mainly, but I'm not closed for learn other languages.
I’m looking to collaborate on a businness who wants to sing a young programmer like me.
I have a high degree in cross-platform application development (touching a lot of Java, Html and CSS 
and Android Studio). Now, I'm studying the same degree but in web.
